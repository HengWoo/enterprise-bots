# File Analysis Test Results

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Partial Success - Issues Discovered

---

## Test Scope

Testing if the financial_analyst bot can analyze Excel files when they're uploaded to Campfire.

## Architecture Validation

### ✅ Working Components

1. **Campfire MCP (SDK-based)**: Fully functional
   - `search_conversations` ✅
   - `get_user_context` ✅
   - `save_user_preference` ✅

2. **Financial MCP (stdio) - Partial**:
   - `calculate` tool ✅ Working (tested with ROI calculation)
   - Other tools ❌ Not accessible by agent

### ❌ Issues Discovered

#### Issue 1: Incorrect Tool List Documentation

**Problem**: Our documentation listed tools that don't exist in the Financial MCP.

**Wrong Tool List** (from FINANCIAL_MCP_INTEGRATION.md and campfire_agent.py):
```python
- parse_excel  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
- adaptive_financial_analysis  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
- get_account_hierarchy  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
- get_child_accounts  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
- recall_analysis_insights  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
- suggest_next_steps  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
- ask_clarification_question  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
```

**Actual Tools** (from Financial MCP ToolRegistry):
```python
# Simple Tools (5 tools)
- read_excel_region  # Extract cell regions
- search_in_excel  # Search for text
- get_excel_info  # Get file structure
- calculate  # Math operations ✅ TESTED & WORKING
- show_excel_visual  # Display data

# Navigation Tools (3 tools)
- find_account  # Search accounts
- get_financial_overview  # High-level structure
- get_account_context  # Account with context

# Thinking Tools (3 tools)
- think_about_financial_data
- think_about_analysis_completeness
- think_about_assumptions

# Memory Tools (4 tools)
- save_analysis_insight
- get_session_context
- write_memory_note
- get_session_recovery_info

# Complex Tools (1 tool)
- validate_account_structure  # MANDATORY first step for financial reports
```

**Fix Applied**: Updated `campfire_agent.py` src/campfire_agent.py:61-83 with correct tool list.

#### Issue 2: Agent Cannot Access Most Financial MCP Tools

**Symptom**: Agent reports "tools are not available" even though they're registered.

**Test Results**:
```
✅ calculate tool: WORKS
❌ get_excel_info: "not available"
❌ read_excel_region: "not available"
❌ validate_account_structure: "not available"
```

**Agent Response**:
> "It appears that the specific financial analysis tools I expected are not currently available."

**Hypothesis**: Possible causes:
1. Financial MCP subprocess fails to start for Excel-related tools
2. File path permissions issue (agent can't access local filesystem)
3. Tools are registered but fail during execution
4. stdio transport connection drops after first use
5. Different sessions create different MCP instances

**Investigation Needed**:
- [ ] Check Claude Code CLI logs for MCP connection errors
- [ ] Test if all Financial MCP tools work in isolation
- [ ] Verify file path accessibility from MCP subprocess
- [ ] Check if tool failures are silent (no error propagation)

## Context Flow Test

**Question**: How does context flow between Campfire MCP and Financial MCP?

**Expected**:
```
User uploads Excel → Campfire webhook → Flask
  ↓
CampfireAgent builds context (room, user, file_path)
  ↓
Claude Code CLI receives context
  ↓
Agent thinks: "Search for past Q3 data"
  → Uses mcp__campfire__search_conversations(room_id=2)
  → Campfire MCP queries DB
  → Returns: "Q3 target was $2M"
  ↓
Claude Code CLI adds to agent context
  ↓
Agent thinks: "Analyze Excel file"
  → Uses mcp__fin-report-agent__validate_account_structure(file_path=...)
  → Financial MCP executes
  → Returns: Excel structure
  ↓
Agent combines both and responds
```

**Actual**:
```
User uploads Excel → Campfire webhook → Flask
  ↓
CampfireAgent builds context with file_path
  ↓
Claude Code CLI receives context
  ↓
Agent tries: mcp__fin-report-agent__get_excel_info
  ❌ Tool not available (or fails silently)
  ↓
Agent falls back to Read tool (Claude Code built-in)
  ❌ Can't read Excel files
  ↓
Agent gives up: "tools not available"
```

## File Attachment Handling

### ✅ What Works

1. **Webhook payload extraction** src/app.py:192-199:
   ```python
   attachments = payload.get('attachments', [])
   file_paths = []
   for attachment in attachments:
       file_path = attachment.get('path') or attachment.get('download_url')
       if file_path:
           file_paths.append(file_path)
   ```

2. **Context passing** src/app.py:226:
   ```python
   context={'file_paths': file_paths}
   ```

3. **Prompt enhancement** src/campfire_agent.py:211-217:
   ```python
   if file_paths:
       prompt += f"\nAttached Files: {len(file_paths)} file(s)"
       prompt += "\n- For financial reports: START with validate_account_structure"
   ```

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

1. Agent sees the file paths but can't use Financial MCP tools to analyze them
2. Falls back to Claude Code's Read tool (can't read Excel)
3. No error messages - just "tools not available"

## Test Commands

### Test 1: Calculate Tool (Working ✅)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/webhook/financial_analyst \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"creator": {"id": 1, "name": "Test"}, "room": {"id": 2, "name": "Finance"}, "content": "Calculate: 250 * 1.15"}'

# Response: ✅ "250 * 1.15 = 287.50"
```

### Test 2: Excel File Analysis (Failing ❌)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/webhook/financial_analyst \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "creator": {"id": 1, "name": "Test"},
    "room": {"id": 2, "name": "Finance"},
    "content": "Analyze this file",
    "attachments": [{
      "path": "/Users/heng/Development/AI_apps/fin_report_agent/fin_report_agent/sample_restaurant.xlsx"
    }]
  }'

# Response: ❌ "tools not available"
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Debug Financial MCP Connection**
   - Check if Financial MCP subprocess starts for each request
   - Verify stdio transport is stable
   - Look for error logs from Claude Code CLI

2. **Test Tools in Isolation**
   - Test Financial MCP directly (not through Campfire bot)
   - Verify get_excel_info works standalone
   - Check file path permissions

3. **Add Logging**
   - Add debug logging to see which tools are actually registered
   - Log tool execution attempts and failures
   - Check if ClaudeSDKClient sees all tools

### Alternative Approaches

If Financial MCP tools continue failing:

**Option A**: Implement Excel parsing in Campfire MCP
```python
# Add to agent_tools.py
@tool(name="parse_excel_file")
async def parse_excel_tool(args):
    import openpyxl
    # Direct Excel parsing without Financial MCP
```

**Option B**: Use validate_account_structure only
- This is marked as MANDATORY first step
- Maybe it's the only tool that needs to work for initial deployment

**Option C**: Test with simpler file path
- Use absolute path that's definitely accessible
- Test with smaller Excel file
- Verify file exists and is readable

## Summary

### What We Learned

1. **Architecture is sound**: Campfire MCP + Financial MCP multi-server setup works in principle
2. **calculate tool works**: Proves stdio connection can work
3. **Context awareness works**: Agent knows room, user, files attached
4. **File extraction works**: Flask correctly parses attachments

### What's Broken

1. **Most Financial MCP tools unavailable**: Excel-related tools don't work
2. **No error propagation**: Failures are silent, agent just says "not available"
3. **Documentation mismatch**: Listed tools that don't exist

### Critical Question for User

**Does the Financial MCP work standalone (outside Campfire bot)?**

If yes → Problem is in integration
If no → Problem is in Financial MCP itself

**Testing Recommendation**:
```bash
# Test Financial MCP directly
cd /Users/heng/Development/AI_apps/fin_report_agent
python fin_report_agent/run_mcp_server.py

# Then in another terminal, use Claude Code to connect
# and test get_excel_info tool
```
