# v1.0.15 - Agent SDK max_turns Fix (Empty Response Issue)

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** Ready for deployment
**Critical:** YES - Fixes financial analysis empty response bug

---

## Problem Statement

In v1.0.14 production, the agent successfully called MCP tools (Financial MCP) but failed to generate the final text response, resulting in empty messages ("...") posted to Campfire.

**Issue:** Financial Analyst bot could respond to general questions but returned empty responses when asked to analyze financial reports.

**Root Cause:** `ClaudeAgentOptions` was missing the `max_turns` parameter, which defaults to limiting the agent to 1 turn. This caused the agent to stop after calling tools without synthesizing a final response.

**Evidence from Production Logs:**
```
[Background] Calling Claude Agent SDK
[Context] Loaded 10 messages from room 1
[Room Files] Found 10 file(s) in room 1
[Agent SDK] Received: ToolUseBlock
[POST] Message preview: ...  ← Empty response
[Background] Successfully posted response to room 1
```

MCP server logs confirmed tools were executed successfully:
```
2025-10-13 19:57:36 - Tool called: get_excel_info
2025-10-13 19:57:42 - Tool called: show_excel_visual
```

But no `AssistantMessage` with text was generated after tool calls.

## Solution: Add max_turns Parameter

### Root Cause Analysis

The Claude Agent SDK `ClaudeAgentOptions` has a `max_turns` parameter that controls how many conversation turns the agent is allowed to take:

- `max_turns=None` (default) - May default to 1 turn
- `max_turns=1` - One turn only (call tools and stop)
- `max_turns=10` - Up to 10 turns (call tools, then synthesize response)

**From SDK Documentation:**
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
    max_turns=1  # Limits agent to exactly 1 turn
)
```

Without setting `max_turns` explicitly, the agent workflow was:
1. Receive user message → Turn 1 starts
2. Call MCP tools (get_excel_info, show_excel_visual)
3. Turn 1 complete → Stop (no final text generation)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified: `src/campfire_agent.py`

**Location:** Line 131 in `_create_client()` method

**Before:**
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    model=self.bot_config.model,
    system_prompt=self.bot_config.system_prompt,
    mcp_servers=mcp_servers,
    allowed_tools=allowed_tools,
    permission_mode='default',
    cwd="/campfire-files"  # Set working directory for file operations
)
```

**After:**
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    model=self.bot_config.model,
    system_prompt=self.bot_config.system_prompt,
    mcp_servers=mcp_servers,
    allowed_tools=allowed_tools,
    permission_mode='default',
    cwd="/campfire-files",  # Set working directory for file operations
    max_turns=10  # Allow agent to continue after tool calls and generate final response
)
```

**Impact:** Agent now allowed to take up to 10 turns:
1. Turn 1: Receive message, call tools
2. Turn 2: Receive tool results, synthesize final text response
3. Turns 3-10: Available for complex multi-step analysis if needed

---

### 2. Modified: `Dockerfile`

Updated version labels to reflect v1.0.15:

**Line 3-4:**
```dockerfile
# Author: Wu Heng | Date: 2025-10-14
# v1.0.15: Agent SDK max_turns fix - enables final text response after MCP tool calls
```

**Line 30:**
```dockerfile
LABEL version="1.0.15"
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (v1.0.14 - Broken)

**User:** "分析野百灵5-8月报表"

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Call `get_excel_info()` ✅
2. Call `show_excel_visual()` ✅
3. **Stop - no text generation** ❌
4. Post empty response ("...") to Campfire

**Result:** User sees "..." in chat

---

### After (v1.0.15 - Fixed)

**User:** "分析野百灵5-8月报表"

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Call `get_excel_info()` ✅
2. Call `show_excel_visual()` ✅
3. **Synthesize findings into text response** ✅
4. Post comprehensive analysis to Campfire

**Result:** User sees full financial analysis with:
- Excel file structure summary
- Key financial metrics identified
- Insights and recommendations
- Questions for user validation

---

## Testing Plan

### Local Testing (Optional)

```bash
cd /Users/heng/Development/campfire/ai-bot

# Test with local Flask server
FLASK_PORT=5002 TESTING=false CAMPFIRE_URL=https://chat.smartice.ai uv run python src/app.py

# In separate terminal, test webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/webhook/financial_analyst \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "creator": {"id": 1, "name": "Test User"},
    "room": {"id": 1, "name": "Test Room"},
    "content": "分析野百灵5-8月报表"
  }'

# Expected: See full analysis in logs, not just "..."
```

### Production Testing

After deployment, test in Campfire:

**Test 1: General Question (Should still work)**
```
@财务分析师 介绍一下你的功能
```
Expected: Full introduction with capabilities

**Test 2: Financial Analysis (Previously broken, should now work)**
```
@财务分析师 分析野百灵5-8月报表
```
Expected: Full financial analysis with:
- File structure summary
- Key metrics identified
- Analysis insights
- Follow-up questions

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Build Docker Image

```bash
cd /Users/heng/Development/campfire/ai-bot

docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t hengwoo/campfire-ai-bot:1.0.15 \
  -t hengwoo/campfire-ai-bot:latest \
  . 2>&1 | tee /tmp/docker-build-1.0.15.log
```

### Step 2: Push to Docker Hub

```bash
docker push hengwoo/campfire-ai-bot:1.0.15
docker push hengwoo/campfire-ai-bot:latest
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Production Server

Since we're using the `latest` tag, deployment is simple:

```bash
# On DigitalOcean server (via console)
cd /root/ai-service

# Stop current container
docker-compose down

# Pull latest image (now points to 1.0.15)
docker pull hengwoo/campfire-ai-bot:latest

# Start new container
docker-compose up -d

# Verify deployment
docker logs -f campfire-ai-bot
```

### Step 4: Verify Fix

In Campfire, test financial analysis:
```
@财务分析师 分析野百灵5-8月报表
```

Expected logs:
```
[Agent SDK] Received: ToolUseBlock  ← Tool calls
[Agent SDK] Received: AssistantMessage  ← Final text generation (NEW!)
[Agent Message] 根据Excel文件分析...  ← Actual text content
[Streaming] Posted text block to Campfire
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Agent calls MCP tools
- ✅ Agent generates final text response after tools
- ✅ Full analysis posted to Campfire
- ✅ No more empty "..." messages

---

## Benefits

✅ **Financial Analysis Works:** Bot can now analyze Excel files and provide comprehensive reports

✅ **Tool Chain Completion:** Agent completes full workflow: receive → call tools → synthesize → respond

✅ **Multi-Turn Capability:** `max_turns=10` allows complex analysis with multiple tool calls

✅ **No Breaking Changes:** General questions still work as before

✅ **Better User Experience:** Users get actual analysis instead of empty responses

## Technical Details

### Understanding max_turns

From Claude Agent SDK types (`claude_agent_sdk/types.py:312`):
```python
@dataclass
class ClaudeAgentOptions:
    max_turns: int | None = None
```

**How it works:**
- Each "turn" is one complete agentic loop (think → act → observe)
- Turn 1: Agent receives message, decides to call tools
- Turn 2: Agent receives tool results, synthesizes final response
- Without `max_turns`, SDK may default to 1 turn (stop after tool calls)
- Setting `max_turns=10` allows agent to continue and generate final text

**Why 10 turns?**
- 2 turns minimum: Call tools + synthesize response
- Extra turns (3-10): Handle complex multi-step analysis
- Financial reports may require: explore → validate → calculate → summarize
- 10 turns provides safety margin without excessive API costs

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the following production issues:

1. **Empty Response After Tool Calls**
   - **Symptoms:** Agent posts "..." to Campfire after successful tool execution
   - **Affected:** Financial analysis requests only (general questions worked)
   - **Fix:** Add `max_turns=10` to allow final text generation

2. **MCP Tools Execute But No Synthesis**
   - **Symptoms:** MCP server logs show successful tool calls, but no text generated
   - **Affected:** All bots using external MCP servers
   - **Fix:** Same as above
