# Campfire Knowledge Base

## Quick Start

When users ask about company policies, procedures, or official standards:

1. **Search** - Use `search_knowledge_base` to find relevant documents
2. **List** - Use `list_knowledge_documents` to browse available docs
3. **Read** - Use `read_knowledge_document` to get full content
4. **Cite** - Always reference the source document in your response
5. **Store** (if needed) - Use `store_knowledge_document` to create new official docs

## Usage Workflows

### Workflow 1: Answering Policy Questions

```
User: "What's our expense reimbursement policy?"

Step 1: Search for relevant documents
→ search_knowledge_base(query="expense reimbursement", category="policies")

Step 2: If found, read the full document
→ read_knowledge_document(path="policies/expense-reimbursement.md")

Step 3: Provide answer with citation
→ "According to our Expense Reimbursement Policy (policies/expense-reimbursement.md):
   [Summarize key points]

   Full policy available at: policies/expense-reimbursement.md"
```

### Workflow 2: Browsing Available Documentation

```
User: "What policies do we have?"

Step 1: List documents in policies category
→ list_knowledge_documents(category="policies")

Step 2: Present organized summary
→ "We have the following company policies:

   Financial Policies:
   - Financial Reporting Standards (policies/financial-reporting-standards.md)
   - Expense Reimbursement (policies/expense-reimbursement.md)

   To read any policy, just ask me about it!"
```

### Workflow 3: Multi-Document Research

```
User: "How do approval workflows work for financial reports?"

Step 1: Search for approval workflow procedures
→ search_knowledge_base(query="approval workflow", category="procedures")

Step 2: Search for financial reporting standards
→ search_knowledge_base(query="financial reporting", category="policies")

Step 3: Read relevant documents
→ read_knowledge_document(path="procedures/approval-workflows.md")
→ read_knowledge_document(path="policies/financial-reporting-standards.md")

Step 4: Synthesize information from multiple sources
→ "The approval workflow for financial reports involves:

   According to Approval Workflows (procedures/approval-workflows.md):
   [Workflow steps]

   And per Financial Reporting Standards (policies/financial-reporting-standards.md):
   [Reporting requirements]

   Sources:
   - procedures/approval-workflows.md
   - policies/financial-reporting-standards.md"
```

### Workflow 4: Creating New Documentation

```
User: "Can you document our new remote work policy?"
[User provides policy details]

Step 1: Confirm with user
→ "I'll create a new policy document. Please confirm:
   Category: policies
   Title: Remote Work Policy
   Content: [show summary]

   Should I proceed?"

Step 2: Store the document
→ store_knowledge_document(
     category="policies",
     title="Remote Work Policy",
     content="[full policy text]",
     author="[user name]"
   )

Step 3: Confirm creation
→ "✅ Remote Work Policy has been created and stored at:
   policies/remote-work-policy.md

   It's now available for all team members to reference."
```

## Search Best Practices

### Effective Search Queries

**Good queries (specific keywords):**
- "expense reimbursement"
- "financial reporting standards"
- "approval workflow"
- "account classification"

**Poor queries (too vague):**
- "policy" (use category filter instead)
- "how to" (be more specific)
- "company rules" (use specific topic)

### Category Filtering

Use category parameter to narrow results:
- `category="policies"` - Company policies only
- `category="procedures"` - Operational procedures only
- `category="financial"` - Financial standards only
- `category="technical"` - Technical documentation only
- `category=None` - Search all categories (default)

### Handling No Results

```python
results = search_knowledge_base(query="xyz policy")

if len(results) == 0:
    # Try alternative searches
    results = search_knowledge_base(query="xyz")  # Broaden query
    results = list_knowledge_documents()  # Show all available

    # Inform user
    "I couldn't find a specific policy about 'xyz'. Here are our available policies: [list]"
```

## Citation Guidelines

### Always Cite Sources

**Format 1: Inline Citation**
```
According to our Financial Reporting Standards (policies/financial-reporting-standards.md),
all reports must include...
```

**Format 2: Reference Section**
```
[Your answer]

Sources:
- Financial Reporting Standards: policies/financial-reporting-standards.md
- Approval Workflows: procedures/approval-workflows.md
```

**Format 3: Direct Quote**
```
As stated in our Expense Reimbursement Policy:

> "All expenses must be submitted within 30 days with original receipts."

(Source: policies/expense-reimbursement.md)
```

### Why Citation Matters

- **Credibility**: Shows answer is based on official documentation
- **Traceability**: Users can verify information themselves
- **Updates**: Users know where to look if policy changes
- **Accountability**: Clear source of authoritative information

## Document Organization

### File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `expense-reimbursement.md`
- Be descriptive: `financial-reporting-standards.md` (not `standards.md`)
- Include context: `campfire-bot-usage.md` (not `usage.md`)

### Category Selection Guide

**Choose "policies" when:**
- Document sets company-wide rules
- Applies to all employees
- Requires approval to change
- Examples: HR policies, financial policies, security policies

**Choose "procedures" when:**
- Document describes a process/workflow
- Step-by-step instructions
- Operational how-to guides
- Examples: Approval workflows, onboarding procedures

**Choose "financial" when:**
- Document defines financial standards
- Industry benchmarks or metrics
- Accounting classifications
- Examples: Account codes, ratio definitions, reporting templates

**Choose "technical" when:**
- Document explains technical systems
- Tool/software documentation
- API references, code guides
- Examples: System guides, bot documentation, technical specs

## Error Handling

### No Results Found

```
User: "What's the policy on XYZ?"

If search returns nothing:
→ "I couldn't find a specific policy about XYZ. Let me show you our available policies:

   [Call list_knowledge_documents(category="policies")]

   Would you like me to check any of these?"
```

### Ambiguous Query

```
User: "What's the policy?"

Response:
→ "I'd be happy to help! We have policies on several topics:

   [Call list_knowledge_documents(category="policies")]

   Which policy are you interested in?"
```

### Document Not Found

```
If read_knowledge_document fails:
→ "I found a reference to this document, but couldn't access it.
   The document may have been moved or renamed.

   Let me search for similar documents: [run alternative search]"
```

## Knowledge Base Maintenance

### When to Create New Documents

**Create new document when:**
- New company policy is approved
- Process/workflow is formalized
- Standards are updated
- New technical systems are deployed

**Don't create document for:**
- Individual decisions (use briefings instead)
- Temporary announcements
- Personal notes
- Draft/unapproved content

### Document Update Strategy

**Option 1: Update existing document**
- Read current version
- Modify content
- Store with same path (overwrites)
- Document version history in content

**Option 2: Create versioned document**
- Store new version with date suffix
- Example: `expense-reimbursement-2025.md`
- Keep old version for reference

## Example Interactions
