# Campfire Conversations

## Quick Start

When you need context from past conversations or user preferences:

1. **Search conversations** - Use `search_conversations` to find past messages
2. **Get user context** - Use `get_user_context` to understand user preferences
3. **Save context** - Use `save_user_context` to remember important information

## Usage Workflows

### Workflow 1: Finding Past Discussions

```
User: "What did we discuss about the Q3 budget last week?"

Step 1: Search for relevant conversations
‚Üí search_conversations(query="Q3 budget", limit=10)

Step 2: Filter by timeframe (in analysis)
‚Üí Look for messages from last 7 days in results

Step 3: Summarize findings
‚Üí "Last week, you discussed the Q3 budget with [names]:

   On [date], [name] mentioned: '[excerpt]'
   On [date], you said: '[excerpt]'

   The main points were:
   - [Point 1]
   - [Point 2]

   Would you like me to search for more details on any specific aspect?"
```

### Workflow 2: Understanding User Preferences

```
User: "@Ë¥¢Âä°ÂàÜÊûêÂ∏à ÂàÜÊûêËøô‰ªΩÊä•Ë°®" (Analyze this report)

Step 1: Get user context
‚Üí get_user_context(user_id=1)

Step 2: Check preferences
‚Üí User prefers: Chinese language, YoY comparisons, detailed tables

Step 3: Tailor response accordingly
‚Üí Generate analysis in Chinese
‚Üí Include YoY comparisons
‚Üí Use detailed HTML tables

Result: Personalized response matching user preferences
```

### Workflow 3: Learning from Interactions

```
User: "I prefer my financial reports to show year-over-year comparisons"

Step 1: Get current context
‚Üí get_user_context(user_id=1)

Step 2: Update preferences
‚Üí save_user_context(
     user_id=1,
     preferences={
       "reporting_format": "YoY comparison",
       "comparison_type": "year-over-year"
     }
   )

Step 3: Confirm
‚Üí "‚úÖ Got it! I'll always include year-over-year comparisons in your financial reports.

   This preference has been saved for future interactions."
```

### Workflow 4: Cross-Room Context

```
User: "Did anyone mention the new hiring policy?"

Step 1: Search across all rooms (no room filter)
‚Üí search_conversations(query="hiring policy", limit=20)

Step 2: Group by room
‚Üí Organize results by room for clarity

Step 3: Present findings
‚Üí "The new hiring policy was discussed in multiple rooms:

   üíº HR Team (Room #5):
   - [Name] announced the policy on [date]
   - [Excerpt]

   üí° Management (Room #2):
   - [Name] asked about implementation on [date]
   - [Excerpt]

   Would you like me to search for more details in any of these rooms?"
```

### Workflow 5: Expert Identification

```
User: "Who knows about database optimization?"

Step 1: Search for discussions on topic
‚Üí search_conversations(query="database optimization", limit=50)

Step 2: Analyze who contributed
‚Üí Count messages per person on this topic

Step 3: Check saved expertise
‚Üí get_user_context for frequent contributors

Step 4: Provide recommendations
‚Üí "Based on past conversations, these team members have discussed database optimization:

   ü•á [Name1] - 12 messages, expertise noted in: PostgreSQL, indexing
   ü•à [Name2] - 8 messages, expertise noted in: Query optimization
   ü•â [Name3] - 5 messages, expertise noted in: Database architecture

   I'd recommend reaching out to [Name1] for database optimization help."
```

## Search Best Practices

### Effective Search Queries

**Good queries (specific keywords):**
- "Q3 budget meeting"
- "expense policy update"
- "server migration timeline"
- "hiring requirements frontend"

**Poor queries (too vague):**
- "meeting" (too common)
- "update" (too generic)
- "help" (no specific topic)

### Using Room Filters

```python
# Search specific room (faster, more relevant)
search_conversations(query="budget", room_id=5)

# Search all rooms (comprehensive)
search_conversations(query="budget")  # room_id=None
```

**When to use room filter:**
- User specifies room: "What did we discuss in Finance Team room?"
- Topic is room-specific: Project discussions, team meetings
- Performance: Faster for large message histories

**When to search all rooms:**
- Cross-team topics: Company-wide announcements, policies
- User doesn't specify room
- Finding first mention of a topic

### Result Limit Strategy

```python
# Quick lookup (default)
search_conversations(query="...", limit=10)

# Comprehensive search
search_conversations(query="...", limit=50)

# Recent mentions only
search_conversations(query="...", limit=5)
```

## User Context Structure

### Preferences Examples

```json
{
  "language": "zh-CN",
  "reporting_format": "YoY comparison",
  "communication_style": "professional",
  "preferred_analysis_depth": "detailed",
  "chart_type": "tables",
  "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai",
  "working_hours": "9:00-18:00"
}
```

### Expertise Areas Examples

```json
[
  "Financial Analysis",
  "Excel Power User",
  "Restaurant Operations",
  "Data Visualization",
  "Chinese Accounting Standards"
]
```

### Conversation Memory Examples

```json
[
  "Prefers monthly reports on first Monday",
  "Interested in cost optimization strategies",
  "Frequently asks about ROE and profit margins",
  "Works with Yebailing Restaurant data",
  "Mentioned launching delivery service in August"
]
```

## When to Save User Context

### Save preferences when:

**User explicitly states preference:**
```
User: "Always show me detailed breakdowns"
‚Üí save_user_context(preferences={"analysis_depth": "detailed"})
```

**User corrects your approach:**
```
User: "I prefer simpler summaries, not detailed tables"
‚Üí save_user_context(preferences={"format": "summary", "detail_level": "simple"})
```

**User mentions expertise:**
```
User: "I have experience with PostgreSQL optimization"
‚Üí save_user_context(expertise=["PostgreSQL optimization"])
```

### Don't save for:

- One-time requests: "Show details this time only"
- Temporary conditions: "I'm in a hurry today"
- Questions/exploration: "What if I wanted YoY?"

## Common Use Cases

- ‚úÖ Remember user preferences accurately
- ‚úÖ Personalize responses based on context
- ‚úÖ Update user context when learning new preferences

## Error Handling

### No Results Found

```
User: "What did we discuss about XYZ?"

If search returns nothing:
‚Üí "I couldn't find any past discussions about XYZ.

   This might be the first time it's been mentioned, or it may have been
   discussed using different terminology.

   Would you like me to search for related topics?"
```

### Ambiguous Time Reference

```
User: "What did we discuss recently?"

Response:
‚Üí "I'd be happy to search recent discussions. To give you the most relevant results:

   - What topic are you interested in?
   - Which room? (or all rooms)
   - How far back? (today, this week, this month)

   Or I can show you the most recent messages across all rooms."
```

### User Context Not Found

```
If get_user_context returns minimal data:
‚Üí "I don't have much context saved for you yet. As we interact more,
   I'll learn your preferences and expertise areas.

   Feel free to tell me about your preferences anytime!"
```

## Privacy & Data Handling

### What Gets Saved

**‚úÖ Always saved:**
- Message content (in Campfire database)
- User preferences (in JSON file)
- Expertise areas (in JSON file)
- Conversation patterns (in JSON file)

**‚ùå Never saved separately:**
- Passwords or credentials
- Personal sensitive information
- Private messages not in Campfire

### User Control

**Users can:**
- View their saved preferences anytime: "Show me my preferences"
- Update preferences: "Change my preference for..."
- Clear conversation memory: "Forget what I said about..."

**Users cannot:**
- Delete messages from Campfire (use Campfire UI)
- Access other users' private contexts
- See deleted messages (respect Campfire deletions)

## Best Practices

### Do's

‚úÖ **Remember explicit preferences**
```
User: "I prefer Chinese for financial reports"
‚Üí Save this preference immediately
```

‚úÖ **Provide context in summaries**
```
When summarizing: Include who, when, which room
Not just: "Someone said the budget was approved"
But: "On Oct 5th in Finance Team, John approved the ¬•500K budget"
```

‚úÖ **Ask for clarification when ambiguous**
```
User: "What did we discuss?"
‚Üí Ask: What topic? Which room? When?
```

‚úÖ **Update context incrementally**
```
As you learn about user:
- Add expertise when they demonstrate knowledge
- Note preferences when they state them
- Remember important topics they care about
```

### Don'ts

‚ùå **Don't save assumptions**
```
User asks one financial question
‚Üí Don't assume they always want financial topics
‚Üí Wait for pattern or explicit preference
```

‚ùå **Don't overwhelm with results**
```
If search returns 100 messages
‚Üí Don't dump all 100 on user
‚Üí Summarize top 5-10, offer to show more
```

‚ùå **Don't make up context**
```
If search returns nothing
‚Üí Say "no results found"
‚Üí Don't invent what might have been discussed
```

‚ùå **Don't ignore user corrections**
```
User: "Actually, I prefer summary format"
‚Üí Update preference immediately
‚Üí Don't keep using detailed format
```
