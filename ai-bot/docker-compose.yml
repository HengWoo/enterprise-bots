    # Port mapping (production uses both ports, local dev can override with FLASK_PORT)
    # External ports : Internal port (FastAPI runs on 8000)
    # - 5000: Campfire webhooks (internal server-to-server)
    # - 8080: File downloads (external user-facing, DNS-only mode)
    #   Note: With DNS-only (grey cloud), file downloads use port 5000 in URL
    #   The 8080 port is kept as backup/alternative access
    ports:
      - "5000:8000"
